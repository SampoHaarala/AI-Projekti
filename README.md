# AI-Projekti
My humble attempt at a general AI. Language based.
# Description of how it should work:
Define a list of starting Item Nodes that will be construct the behaviour of the AI.
Data is constructed using processes. Processes can be math functions like +/- or reading a certain file.
The overall behaviour should have the goal of expanding. By this I mean finding out more information.
Depending on the start nodes, values can be set using polarities(positive or negative values).
